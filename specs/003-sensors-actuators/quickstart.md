# Quickstart Guide: Chapter 3 - Sensors and Actuators in Physical AI

## Overview
This guide provides a quick introduction to the key concepts covered in Chapter 3, focusing on sensors and actuators in Physical AI systems. This chapter explores how robots perceive their environment through sensors and interact with the physical world through actuators.

## Key Concepts

### Sensors in Physical AI
- **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Measure internal state (position, velocity, acceleration)
- **Exteroceptive Sensors**: Measure external environment (cameras, LIDAR, touch sensors)
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining multiple sensor inputs for robust perception
- **Calibration**: Ensuring sensor accuracy and reliability

### Actuators in Physical AI
- **Electric Motors**: DC, stepper, and servo motors for precise control
- **Hydraulic/Pneumatic Actuators**: High force applications
- **Shape Memory Alloys**: Bio-inspired actuation
- **Control Systems**: Feedback control for precise actuator operation

### Sensor-Actuator Integration
