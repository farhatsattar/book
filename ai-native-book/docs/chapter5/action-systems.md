# Action Systems and Control

## Introduction

Action systems in robotics are responsible for executing physical actions based on perception and planning. These systems bridge the gap between high-level decisions and low-level actuator commands.

## Motor Control and Actuation

Motor control systems manage the low-level control of actuators:

- Position control for precise positioning
- Velocity control for motion control
- Force control for interaction with the environment
- Torque control for compliant behavior

## Planning and Execution

Action systems must coordinate with planning systems to execute complex tasks:

- Trajectory generation and execution
- Task-level planning and execution
- Multi-step action sequences
- Error handling and recovery

## Feedback Mechanisms

Effective action systems require robust feedback mechanisms:

- State estimation and monitoring
- Performance metrics and evaluation
- Error detection and correction
- Adaptive control based on feedback

## Integration with Perception Systems

Action systems must be tightly integrated with perception systems:

- Closed-loop control using sensor feedback
- Reactive behaviors based on environmental changes
- Coordination between perception and action cycles
- Timing synchronization between systems

## Real-time Control Considerations

Action systems must meet strict real-time requirements:

- Control loop timing constraints
- Deterministic execution
- Priority-based scheduling
- Deadline management

## Summary

Action systems are critical for translating high-level decisions into physical robot behavior. Effective action systems require careful design of control algorithms, feedback mechanisms, and integration with perception systems.
