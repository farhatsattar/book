# Chapter 4 and 5 Implementation

## Prompt

Implement Chapter 4 (ROS 2 and Robot Control Systems) and Chapter 5 (AI Perception and Action Integration) for the Physical AI textbook.

## Response

Successfully completed implementation of both Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for the Physical AI textbook.

### Chapter 4: ROS 2 and Robot Control Systems
- Created comprehensive content covering ROS 2 fundamentals, robot control architectures, integration with Physical AI, and real-world applications
- Added visual aids with figures throughout the chapter
- Included key terms, code examples, and practical case studies
- Completed all sections: index, fundamentals, control architecture, integration, and applications

### Chapter 5: AI Perception and Action Integration
- Created detailed content covering perception-action loops, sensor integration, AI perception systems, action systems, integration architectures, case studies, and future directions
- Added visual aids with figures throughout the chapter
- Included key terms, code examples, and practical applications
- Completed all sections: index, perception-action loop, sensor integration, AI perception, action systems, integration architectures, case studies, and challenges-future

### Technical Implementation
- Updated navigation in sidebars.js to include both chapters
- Created proper directory structures for both chapters
- Ensured consistent formatting and style with other textbook chapters
- Implemented all learning objectives as specified in the requirements

Both chapters are now ready for publication as part of the Physical AI textbook.
